# IMarketplace Contract
## Overview
The IMarketplace Contract is an interface developed in Solidity that defines the functionalities for a marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows for listing, buying, making offers, cancelling offers, setting minimum offer price, setting fee ratios, and withdrawing benefits from the marketplace. 
## Version Details
The contract was developed using Solidity version  `0.8.0` .
## Dependencies
The contract does not depend on any external libraries.
## Technologies
The IMarketplace Contract is built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts.
## Architecture and Design Patterns
The IMarketplace Contract is designed using the interface pattern, which allows other contracts to implement the functionalities required for a marketplace.
## Functions
### Public Functions
####  `list(address collection, uint256 tokenId)` 
Lists the item with the specified collection and token ID.

 ## Additional Notes or Documentation
The IMarketplace Contract defines the functionalities required for a marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain. This interface can be implemented by other contracts to provide the required marketplace functionalities. The interface is designed to be modular and flexible to allow for integration with other smart contracts.
